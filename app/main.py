# OPERATION CLASSES (COMMAND AND TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERNS)
# ==============================================================================

# Who: These classes are the core components that perform arithmetic operations.
# What: Implement arithmetic operations using design patterns.
# Why: To demonstrate OOP principles and design patterns for clean, maintainable code.
# Where: In the calculator application we are building.
# When: Whenever an arithmetic operation is requested.
# How: By defining a base class and extending it for specific operations.

# We will implement the Command Pattern, where each operation (e.g., addition, subtraction)
# is encapsulated as an object. The Template Method Pattern is used to define the
# skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.

# Why use the Template Method Pattern here?
# - It defines the algorithm's skeleton in a method (`calculate`), deferring some steps (`execute`) to subclasses.
# - Promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent structure across different operations.

# ==============================================================================
# FACTORY PATTERN FOR CREATING OPERATIONS
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The OperationFactory class.
# What: Creates instances of operation classes based on a given operation name.
# Why: To encapsulate object creation, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
# Where: Used whenever a new operation needs to be created based on user input.
# When: At runtime, during the calculator's execution.
# How: By mapping operation names to their corresponding classes.

# Why use the Factory Pattern?

# - Enhances flexibility and scalability; new operations can be added without modifying existing code.

# ==============================================================================
# SINGLETON PATTERN FOR ENSURING ONE CALCULATOR INSTANCE
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The SingletonCalculator class.
# What: Ensures only one instance of the calculator exists.
# Why: To have a single shared state (e.g., calculation history) across the application.

# ==============================================================================
# STRATEGY PATTERN FOR OPERATION SELECTION
# ==============================================================================

# What: Represents a calculation using a specific strategy (operation).

# How: By holding a reference to a strategy object and executing it.

# RUNNING THE CALCULATOR PROGRAM

    # It will not run if the script is imported as a module.

# General Programming Good Practices Demonstrated:
# - **Modular Design**: The code is organized into classes and functions, making it easier to understand and maintain.
# - **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting data hiding and abstraction.
# - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Base classes define common interfaces, and derived classes implement specific behaviors.
# - **Exception Handling**: The code anticipates and handles potential errors gracefully, providing informative feedback.
# - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented to track the application's behavior and assist in debugging.
# - **Type Hinting**: Type hints improve code readability and help with static analysis tools.
# - **Documentation and Comments**: Detailed comments and docstrings explain the purpose and functionality of code components.
# - **Adherence to PEP 8**: The code follows Python's style guidelines for improved readability.

# Conclusion:
# This code serves as a comprehensive example of how to implement several key object-oriented design patterns in Python.
# By understanding the who, what, why, where, when, and how of each component, students can gain a deeper appreciation
# for the art and science of OOP. The combination of design patterns, logging, debugging, and good programming practices
# results in code that is robust, maintainable, and scalable.
